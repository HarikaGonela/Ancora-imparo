<p>Nothing ends nicely, that's why it ends.<br>
    I disagree with people who think you learn more from getting beat up than you do from winning.<br>
    I love kids. I was a kid myself, once.<br>
    I always look for a challenge and something that's different.<br>
    When you have to cope with a lot of problems, you're either going to sink or you're going to swim.<br>
    I'm passionate about learning. I'm passionate about life.<br>
    Talk is over-rated as a means of settling disputes.<br>
    I would live with all of my sisters if I could. We've always been very close, my sisters and me.<br>
    I didn't become an actor to have power, but it just happens that I have it and so I have a lot of opportunities.<br>
    When you become successful in any type of life, there are people who are not contributing to the motion.<br>
